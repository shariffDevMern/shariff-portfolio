            Hello, I'm Deepika P, an aspiring Software Developer currently
            pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology at Panimalar Institute
            of Technology, Chennai. With a strong foundation in programming and
            problem-solving, I am passionate about creating high-quality,
            user-centric software solutions. From developing secure platforms
            using blockchain to building responsive e-commerce websites, I have
            honed my technical skills through academic and self-initiated
            projects. My expertise spans frontend technologies like HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and React.js, as well as backend frameworks like Node.js
            and Spring Boot. I am also well-versed in databases such as MySQL
            and tools like Git and GitHub. I have further enhanced my skill set
            through certifications in Java, Full Stack Development, and Machine
            Learning, and gained hands-on experience during internships in AI
            and Machine Learning. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the
            tech industry while continuously learning and growing. If you share
            a passion for technology, innovation, or software development, I'd
            love to connect. Letâ€™s collaborate and explore how we can drive
            impactful solutions in this ever-evolving digital landscape!
